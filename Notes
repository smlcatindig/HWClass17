Constructor:
A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object
of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object with the values
provided as arguments to the constructor. If no constructor is defined
in a class, a default constructor is automatically created by Java.

Rules:
1.) Constructors must have same name as class name.
2.) Constructors don't have return types not even void.
3.) When we don't create a Constructors in a class, Java creates a default constructor for us
automatically behind the scenes. It is called default constructor. It does not take any parameter.
